## The model

The app is based on the **back-off algorithm** which first attempts to apply a prediction based on a 6 word ngram. 

Should it not succeed, it will back off to the 5 word ngram, which can eventually reach the 1 word ngram for which the word with the highest frequency is selected. 


## The data

From each of the US **twitter**, **news** and **blogs** datasets a 5% random sample was extracted. 

The data was cleaned and **6 ngrams** were extracted which were saved as an workspace image to ensure that the app would load smoothly.

## The app

Use the **app** [here](https://renee-pesor.shinyapps.io/TextPredictor/) by typing words (and selecting the number of predictions if needed).

## That is all!
